In the Map View page, users can scroll around a map and click on certain "pin points", which map to specific major events during WW2. Major events are certain events that changed the direction of the war, thus bearing a more significant standing than other events on the app. When a user clicks on a pin, the app will redirect them to a Content View of that specific event.
